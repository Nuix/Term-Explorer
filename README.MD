# Getting Started

## Setup

Begin by downloading the latest release of this code.  Extract the contents of the archive into your Nuix scripts directory.  In Windows the script directory is likely going to be either of the following:

- `%appdata%\Nuix\Scripts` - User level script directory
- `%programdata%\Nuix\Scripts` - System level script directory

[PROJECT_USAGE_SECTIONS]

# Cloning this Repository

This script also relies on code from [SuperUtilities](https://github.com/Nuix/SuperUtilities), which contains the code to do perform the term expansion.  This JAR file is not included in the repository (although it is included in release downloads).  If you clone this repository, you will also want to obtain a copy of SuperUtilities.jar by either:
1. Building it from [the source](https://github.com/Nuix/SuperUtilities)
2. Downloading an already built JAR file from the [Nx releases](https://github.com/Nuix/SuperUtilities/releases)

Once you also have a copy of SuperUtilities.jar, make sure to include it in the same directory as the script.
